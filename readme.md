# Developer Roadmap in 2018
You develop code in [Smarter.Codes](https://smarter.codes/) as Full Stack Web Developer, as Computational Linguist, and as DevOps. You review code and take control of shipment schedule as a Software Architect. **This guide helps suggest newbie (and experienced alike) on what to skills to keep yourself abreast of when contributing at Smarter.Codes.**

Below you find a set of charts demonstrating the paths that you can take and the technologies that you would want to adopt in order to become a :
* [Frontend Developer](#-frontend-roadmap)
* [Backend developer](#-backend-roadmap)
* [DevOps](#-devops-roadmap)
* [Computational Linguist](#-computational-linguist-roadmap)
* [Software Architect](#-software-architect-roadmap)

> These charts were inspired from [Karman Ahmed](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) who had build them originally for his old professor friend to share with his college students to give them a perspective.
